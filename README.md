# Custom Calibration Pattern for 3D reconstruction with Python
**ON GOING UNIVERSITY PROJECT**


Python implementation of ccalib.cpp from OpenCV.
opencv_contrib/modules/ccalib/src/ccalib.cpp is part of the Multi-camera Calibration code provided in the famous distribution OpenCV. 
Actually there is no implementation for its use in Python so the main purpose of this project is to provide something similar to use in Python
although it will certainly have less performance.

## HOW TO USE:
```
python randpattern.py --/path/pattern --/path/input/images --width object in mm --height object in mm
```
